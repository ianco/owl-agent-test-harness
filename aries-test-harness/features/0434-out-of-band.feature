Feature: RFC 0434 Intiating exchange using the Out of Band protocol
   In order to intiate the exchange with another agent,
   As a sender or a receiver,
   I want to use Out of Band(RFC0434) protocols to accomplish this.

   Scenario: Issue a v1 indy credential using connectionless out of band invitation
      Given we have "2" agents
         | name | role   |
         | Acme | issuer |
         | Bob  | holder |
      Given "Acme" is ready to issue a "indy" credential
      When "Acme" creates a credential offer
      And "Acme" sends a connectionless out of band invitation to "Bob" with "credential-offer"
      And "Bob" receives the invitation
      And "Bob" requests the credential
      And "Acme" issues the credential
      And "Bob" acknowledges the credential issue
      Then "Bob" has the credential issued

   Scenario Outline: Issue a v2 credential using connectionless out of band invitation
      Given we have "2" agents
         | name | role   |
         | Acme | issuer |
         | Bob  | holder |
      Given "Acme" is ready to issue a "indy" credential
      When "Acme" creates an "indy" credential offer with <credential_data>
      And "Acme" sends a connectionless out of band invitation to "Bob" with "credential-offer"
      And "Bob" receives the invitation
      And "Bob" requests the "indy" credential
      And "Acme" issues the "indy" credential
      And "Bob" acknowledges the "indy" credential issue
      Then "Bob" has the "indy" credential issued

      And "Bob" receives the invitation
      And "Bob" makes the presentation of the proof
      And "Faber" acknowledges the proof
      Then "Bob" has the proof verified
